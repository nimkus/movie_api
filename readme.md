## Project Context

This project is a backend for a movie management system called **MyFlix**. It enables users to browse and save their favorite movies, directors, and genres. The project aims to demonstrate mastery in backend development using JavaScript, Node.js, and MongoDB, while also offering user authentication and data validation.

### Objective
The goal is to build the server-side API for a movie web application that allows users to:
- View movie information, including details about genres and directors.
- Register, update, and manage their user profiles.
- Save and manage a list of favorite movies.

### MERN Stack
The project is part of the **MERN** stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js), with this backend focusing on the first three components.

## User Stories

- As a user, I want to receive information on movies, directors, and genres so that I can learn more about the movies Iâ€™ve watched or am interested in.
- As a user, I want to create a profile so I can save data about my favorite movies.

## Feature Requirements

### Essential Features

- Return a list of all movies.
- Return details about a specific movie (e.g., title, genre, director, description).
- Return information about a genre and its description.
- Return information about a director.
- Allow users to register, update, and delete profiles.
- Allow users to manage their list of favorite movies.

### Optional Features

- Allow users to see which actors star in which movies.
- Allow users to view more detailed information about movies (e.g., release date, ratings).
- Allow users to create a "To Watch" list.

## Technical Requirements

- The API must be built using Node.js and Express.
- The API must use a RESTful architecture.
- The database must be a MongoDB database, modeled with Mongoose.
- The API must provide secure user authentication using JWT.
- Data validation must be implemented on user inputs.
- The project must be tested using tools like Postman.
- The code must be deployed to a public platform like GitHub and Heroku.
